Touch designer descriptions

Week 8: I’m proud of this piece because it looks cool, and it is the first thing I felt confident in while working in touch designer. I created it using 3 noise tops, and a blur loop. I like how it almost looks like an oil spill in a way. 
Week 9: This one Im proud of because I created it using minimal help, and its funky. I used noise, a feedback and lumablur loop, and a I also used a math top for the first time. I really love how there’s two layers of noise on top of each other, but they’re created by the same noise top.
Week 10: This one I don’t fully understand, but I think its really cool and interesting. I used an audio reactive node to make the swirly wire sphere twist on time with the bass. I really enjoy watching it, and I like the song I chose a lot.
